# my_maps

It's just a simple Google Maps with [geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator) package and [goggle_maps_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter) package and one more last but not least [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) package.

this app is integrated with google maps api for search place id by name to get latitude longitude and search nearby places, and with geolocator it can track your location.

NOTE: I cannot share the Api key since it's used billing account so ... put your own key and i can't share the apk either since to hit the api has limit.
